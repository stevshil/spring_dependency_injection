# Java Spring Dependency Injection

This git repository is a tutorial on Spring Boot Dependency Injection.

It starts with understanding abstraction, before moving in to dependency injection, to help understand the different ways in which we can pull in code, and when code is instantiated.

The repository is split in to branches relating to the different ways in which we will work with dependency.

## The branches

*   **main**
    *   Documentation and starting branch
*   **legacy** - without abstraction or dependency injection
    *   How to include classes at runtime
*   **abstraction**
    *   Using Java Abstract classes
*   **dependency injection**
    *   Using dependency injection
